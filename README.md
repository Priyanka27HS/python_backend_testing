Udemy course - API Testing with Python 3 & PyTest, Backend Automation 2023

About this course :

Learn to build a framework for API automation testing (backend testing) using Python and PyTest, SQL, Reports, Docker ...


Course Description :

Learn how to use Python to test the back-end of web services or APIs. We use industry-standard real eCommerce RESTful API to practice testing using Python programming language.

We will build a framework using one of the most popular testing tools PyTest. The framework we will build will be extendable and scalable to be able to include frontend (Selenium WebDriver) testing.

The skills learned here are used in any Web Services testing.


Content and Overview : 

In this course, we will spend some time creating an eCommerce application on our local machine. We will install a package that includes a web server and database. Using this package we will install WordPress and install necessary plugins to make it an eCommerce application. The eCommerce application gives us all the APIs we will test.

We have access to the database so we will test API data against the database. We will create an efficiently structured test framework and learn how to use Python to perform our verification.

We will also learn how to use a Python test runner tool "pytest" and see why test runner tools are critical for automation testing.
