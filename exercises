1. Exercise TCID-61: Verify update 'regular_price' updates the 'price' field

Automate TCID-61: Verify update 'regular_price' updates the 'price' field

Test Case for Products API

Make 'update product' call with data for 'regular_price'. Then verify the 'price' field of the product is updated.

You can verify the 'price' field in the response of the product as well as make a second call to 'retrieve product' and verify that the 'price' field is the same as the 'regular_price' you updated it to.

You can create a new product for the test or get an existing one and update it.

Solution:

The solution is provided in the course material. Compare your code to the given code.

Run -> pytest -m tcid61



2. Exercise TCID-63: Verify update 'sale_price > 0' will set field 'on_sale'=True

Automate TCID-63: Verify update 'sale_price > 0' will set field 'on_sale'=True

Test Case for Products API

Make 'update product' call with data for 'sale_price' that is greater than 0. Example {'sale_price': '10.99'}.

Then verify the 'on_sale' field of the product is updated to 'True'.

You can verify the 'on_sale' field in the response of the product as well as make a second call to 'retrieve product' and verify that the 'on_sale' field is True.

You can create a new product for the test or get an existing one and update it. If you are using an existing product, you have to make sure you are not getting a product that is already in 'on_sale=True' status.


Solution:
The solution is provided in the course material. Compare your code to the given code.

3. Exercise TCID-64: Verify update 'sale_price=" "' will set field 'on_sale'=False

Automate TCID-64: Verify update 'sale_price=" "' will set field 'on_sale'=False

Test Case for Products API

Make 'update product' call with empty string for 'sale_price' and verify the 'on_sale' field will get set to False.

The product for the test must already have 'on_sale'=True.

You can verify the 'on_sale' field in the response of the product as well as make a second call to 'retrieve product' and verify that the 'on_sale' field is True.

You can create a new product for the test or get an existing one and update it. If you are using existing product, you have to make sure you are not getting a product that is  'on_sale=False' status.


Solution:
Solution is provided in the course material. Compare your code to the given code.

Automate TCID-65: Verify update 'sale_price' updates the 'sale_price' field

Test Case for Products API

Make 'update product' call with data for 'sale_price'. Then verify the 'sale_price' field of the product is updated.

You can verify the 'sale_price' field in the response of the product as well as make a second call to 'retrieve product' and verify that the 'sale_price' field is the same as the value in the payload.

You can create a new product for the test or get an existing one and update it.


Solution:
The solution is provided in the course material. Compare your code to the given code.


Run -> pytest -m tcid65



5. Exercise TCID-60: Order with 50% off coupon should reduce total by 50%

Automate TCID-60: Order with 50% off coupon should reduce the total by 50%

Test Case for Orders API

Create order and include a 50% off coupon. Verify the 'total' in the response. The 'total' price should be 50% of the product price.

Tip:

* Create/Find a coupon that is 50% off (decide to hard code it or get a new one on every run)
* Create/Find a product and note the price
* Create the order and verify

Solution:

The solution is provided in the course material. Compare your code to the given code.

Run -> pytest -m tcid60



6. Exercise TCID-37: Create a new coupon with 'discount_type=percent'

Automate TCID-37: Verify 'POST /coupons' creates a new coupon with 'discount_type=percent'

Test Case for Coupons API

Make a call to 'POST coupons' to create a coupon with 'discount_type=percent' and verify the coupon is created.

You can verify by getting the coupon from the database or making a 'retrieve coupon' API call.

Solution:
The solution is provided in the course material. Compare your code to the given code.

Run -> pytest -m tcid37



7. Exercise TCID-38: Create a new coupon with 'discount_type=fixed_cart'

Automate TCID-38: Verify 'POST /coupons' creates a new coupon with 'discount_type=fixed_cart''

Test Case for Coupons API

Make a call to 'POST /coupons' to create a coupon with 'discount_type=fixed_cart' and verify the coupon is created.

You can verify by getting the coupon from the database or making a 'retrieve coupon' API call.

Tip:
